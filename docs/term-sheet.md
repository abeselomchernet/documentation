# Project Term Sheet: The Country Architect's Workbench MVP (v1.0)

**Date:** September 16, 2025  
**Project Code:** CAW-MVP-1.0

## 1. Strategic Rationale

The Ethiopian financial market is defined by a deep, systemic "Implementation Gap"â€”a dual-sided failure that paralyzes both grassroots access to capital and institutional product origination. Competing in this broken system is a low-margin, "Red Ocean" strategy.

The "Country Architect's Workbench" is architected to be the indispensable operating system for market creation. By operationalizing the proprietary frameworks of the "Country Architect Canvas", this software empowers financial institutions to create uncontested "Blue Ocean" markets. Its primary function is to serve as the engine for building a defensible "Data Asymmetry Flywheel," transforming a client's proprietary data into an unassailable competitive "Data Moat." This MVP serves to validate the core utility of the framework and secure the foundational users required to initiate this flywheel.

## 2. Target User Persona & Value Proposition

The MVP is designed for the Strategic Systems Consultant ("Caroline Reed" persona).

- **Problem:** This user currently relies on a patchwork of generic diagramming tools (e.g., Miro, Visio) to apply their proprietary methodologies, a process that is inefficient, inconsistent, and fails to differentiate their high-value intellectual property.
- **Solution:** The Workbench provides a bespoke, professional, and purpose-built digital environment that transforms their framework from an abstract concept into a tangible, interactive tool. It elevates their professional brand, justifies premium fees, and accelerates the creation of client-ready, strategic deliverables.

## 3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

The scope of the v1.0 build is strictly limited to the core functionality required to diagnose a Vicious Cycle of market failure and architect its corresponding Virtuous Cycle. The development work will be organized into three distinct Epics as detailed in the project blueprint:

- **Epic 1: Canvas & Client Lifecycle Management:** Construct the application's foundational "shell," including secure user authentication, a project dashboard for managing multiple client canvases, and core lifecycle functions (create, edit, delete).
- **Epic 2: Vicious Cycle Diagnosis Canvas:** Create a purpose-built Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) editor that allows the consultant to map system variables (nodes), define cause-and-effect relationships (links), and identify key feedback loops ('Reinforcing' or 'Balancing').
- **Epic 3: Virtuous Cycle Design Canvas:** Engineer the core intellectual property of the "inversion" process. This includes functionality to duplicate the Vicious Cycle as a starting template, full editing capabilities for the new Virtuous Cycle, and a mission-critical "Side-by-Side Comparison View" to visually demonstrate the transformation from problem to solution.

## 4. Foundational Technology Architecture

The MVP will be built on a "compliant-by-design" philosophy, establishing a "Trust Engine" from day one. The initial architecture will anticipate the requirements for the full institutional rollout:

- **Hosting:** A hybrid cloud architecture will be planned for, with the MVP initially deployed on a regional cloud (e.g., GCP africa-south1) for speed and scalability. The architecture will be designed to easily accommodate the on-premise "Sovereign Core" in a Tier III Ethiopian data center (e.g., Raxio) to comply with PDPP 1321/2024 in future versions.
- **Core Logic:** Core business logic will be containerized and managed via Kubernetes (GKE), ensuring scalability and rapid deployment cycles.
- **Data & Reporting:** The canvas data will be stored in a standard relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL). The MVP will include a high-quality PDF export function to ensure professional, client-ready outputs.

## 5. Proposed Development Plan & Next Steps

We will adopt the "learn smart" doctrine outlined in the strategic frameworks. The MVP development will be structured as a disciplined, time-boxed pilot.

1. Finalize Budget & Team: Formalize the development budget and assemble the core agile development team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, 2x Full-Stack Developers).
2. Sprint 1-3 (Epic 1): Focus exclusively on building and testing the core application shell and user management features.
3. Sprint 4-7 (Epic 2): Develop the Vicious Cycle Diagnosis Canvas, focusing on an intuitive and robust CLD editor experience.
4. Sprint 8-10 (Epic 3): Build the Virtuous Cycle Canvas and the critical Side-by-Side comparison view.
5. Pilot Launch: Onboard an initial cohort of 5-10 strategic consultants to validate the MVP's core value proposition and gather feedback for the V2.0 roadmap.

This term sheet is now ready for review and approval. Upon signature, we will proceed immediately to Step 1.
