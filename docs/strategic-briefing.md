# Strategic Briefing to the Investment Committee

**TO:** Principals & Key Stakeholders  
**FROM:** BERHANE (ብርሃኔ)  
**DATE:** September 16, 2025  
**RE:** Status Update & Forward Guidance on the 18-Month De-risking Pilot

## 1. Executive Summary

The full functional specification for the "Country Architect's Workbench" MVP is complete, marking a critical milestone. The development team is now equipped with a comprehensive, strategically-aligned blueprint.

The immediate priority now shifts from software planning to the execution of the broader business strategy. We must formally initiate Phase 1 of the 18-Month De-risking Pilot. This pilot is the core instrument for validating our strategic hypotheses and transforming our blueprint into a de-risked, investment-grade enterprise.

## 2. Re-focusing on the Master Blueprint: The 18-Month Pilot

Our execution will follow the canonical model detailed in the foundational casebook. The 18-month plan is the structured methodology for validating our most critical assumptions with minimal capital investment. The two core phases of this pilot are:

- **Phase 1 (Months 1-9): Foundation & Pilot.** Build the MVP, secure foundational partnerships, and test in a controlled environment.
- **Phase 2 (Months 10-18): Launch & Data Collection.** Limited public launch with partner institution and systematic data collection to refine models and validate the business case.

## 3. The Governance Instrument: The Gating Criteria Scorecard

The pilot's success is governed by the Gating Criteria Scorecard—a "contract for capital" with clear, measurable targets. Follow-on funding for a national scale-up is contingent upon meeting these targets, which are designed to prove our four central strategic hypotheses:

1. **Product-Market Fit (Institutional):** $25M AUM target.
2. **Data Moat Viability:** >95% accuracy target for the V1.0 Credit Score model.
3. **Grassroots Model Viability:** >50% income increase for end-users, <5% default rate.
4. **Regulatory Acceptance:** Products are acceptable to local regulators (NBE/ECMA).

## 4. Strategic Recommendation & Immediate Priorities

**Recommendation:** Formally approve Phase 1 (Months 1-9) of the 18-Month De-risking Pilot.

Capital allocation should be directed toward three mission-critical objectives:

1. Initiate Proactive Regulatory Engagement (NBE/ECMA sandbox).
2. Secure Launch Partner (financial institution).
3. Structure Pilot-Scale Financial Instruments (ECLP, Securitized Credit Fund).

With the blueprint for our core technology complete, the time for high-level planning is over. We must now proceed with disciplined, on-the-ground execution.
